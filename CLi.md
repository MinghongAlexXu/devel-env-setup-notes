## Tips

> When searching for files (as opposed to matching lines in files) you might try `fd` instead of ripgrep. You can pass an `--extension` flag though to `fd` to filter by filetype. `fd` uses some of the same libraries as ripgrep, but is optimized for listing files while ripgrep is optimized for searching within files.
