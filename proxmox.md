From an [official comment](https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/unable-to-install-proxmox-on-lenovo-thinksystem-sr650-7x06.68782/post-308705):
> From the HW support side, Proxmox uses an Ubuntu Kernel.
So every HW where Linux works will work with Proxmox VE.
And more specific Ubuntu has an [HCL](https://certification.ubuntu.com/) where all tested HW is listed.
